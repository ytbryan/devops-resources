 ###Lesson Description - Using Comments

When writing scripts, we often want to leave ourselves notes or explanations. 
Python (along with most scripting languages) uses the # character to signify
that the line should be ignored and not executed.



Single Line Comment

We can comment out a whole line:

  Eg. 1  # This is a full like comment

or we can comment at the end of a line:

  Eg. 2  2 + 2 # This will add the numbers





What About Block Comments?

Python does not have the concept of block commenting that you may have encountered 
in other languages. Many people mistake a triple-quoted string as being a comment, 
but it is not, itâ€™s a multi-line string. That being said, multi-line strings can 
functionally work like comments, but they will still be allocated into memory.

  Eg. 3
"""
This is not a block comment,
but it will still work when you really need 
for some lines of code to not execute.
"""
