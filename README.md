# mansion

Mansion is just a testing repo for learners to commit into open source project.

These are the steps you need to learn:

1. Please do not edit these texts. If you wish to edit, please start at EDIT_ME section

2. Study the structures of a some opensource repo like:
[rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
[flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
[awesome python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)

Look out for the type of files available in their repo and why they are there.

3. Some of the basic files to be included are LICENCE.md, README.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

4. ONLY Submit content relating to Python or DevOps into this `mansion` repo. You can take inspiration from ACG, Class summary or anything good from stackoverflow, github or duckduckgo.

Good luck.
