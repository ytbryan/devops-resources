# mansion

Mansion is just a testing repo for learners to commit into open source project.

These are the steps you need to learn:

1. Please do not edit these texts. If you wish to edit, please start at EDIT_ME section

2. Study the structures of a some opensource repo like:
[rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
[flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
[awesome python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)

Look out for the type of files available in their repo and why they are there.

3. Some of the basic files to be included are LICENCE.md, README.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

4. ONLY Submit content relating to Python or DevOps into this `mansion` repo. You can take inspiration from ACG, Class summary or anything good from stackoverflow, github or duckduckgo.

Good luck.

### Popular Text Editor
  1.Vim
  
  Almost all Linux distributions, even older versions, come with the Vim editor installed. Vim stands for Vi Improved, meaning that Vim is a modified and improved version of  the old Vi text editor.

  **Pros**: Vim supports automatic commands, digraph inputs (useful in programming), split and session screens, tabs, colored schemes (color-coded by function), and tagging.   It can be configured with plugins and comes with a tutorial (invoked with the vimtutor command). When you master the commands, Vim is very efficient.

  **Cons**: It does not have a GUI. The only way you can initiate Vim is from the command line. The interface is user-unfriendly, while some commands are not intuitive. Coding a file from scratch would be too complicated. The learning curve can be steep, but Vim is very popular in the Linux community.

 2.Nano
 
 Nano is a revision of an older editor called Pico and comes pre-loaded on most Linux installations. Nano is an ideal lightweight editor for beginners. It’s a lot easier to  use than Vim , so it’s worth learning Nano for quick configuration edits.

 **Pros**: It supports GNU Autoconf, interactive search-and-replace, auto-indent, and spellcheck. Nano is intuitive and easy to use. It lists the keystroke commands at the bottom of the editor, so you don’t have to memorize or look them up.

 **Cons**: The list of commands is short and some may be unintuitive.
